# DatingApp
This is an application made through a course from Udemy. The purpose of this application is to learn and understand the basic
steps of making a Full-Stack web app using ASP.NET and Angular. In this application is included user authentication, messaging
service between two users and other functionalities such as liking another user. The API was created using ASP.NET Core and the client was created using Angular and TypeScript.
For the entities created in the API part first I used Entity Framework Core afterwards the entities were updated to Entity Framework Core Identity. The security part was
realised with JWT Authentication.
